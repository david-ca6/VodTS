# VodTS

# Description
VodTS is a browser extension that displays clickable timestamps for YouTube and Twitch.
It allows you to easily navigate and share specific moments in videos by clicking on timestamps.
On YouTube timestamps are loaded from the video's comments, or from the user's clipboard.
On Twitch timestamps can only be added from the user's clipboard.
The extension can also be used to create a timestamp for videos or livestreams.
The shortcut to create a timestamp is Ctrl+Shift+Z.
